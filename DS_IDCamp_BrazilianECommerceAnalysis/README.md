# Background
RFM analysis is one of the widely used technique to gain insight into customer behavior and segmentation that categorizes customers based on three key metrics: Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value. This project aims to do RFM Analysis on E-commerce where the dataset is public dataset of orders made at Olist Store. The dataset has information on 100 thousand orders from 2016 to 2018 made in several marketplaces in Brazil. Beside RFM analysis, I also performed data exploration to gain more insight from the dataset.
  
# Analysis Questions
1. Question 1: How is the distribution of customers based on recency?
2. Question 2: How is the distribution of customers based on purchase frequency?
3. Question 3: How is the distribution of customers based on monetary value/spending amount?
3. Question 4: Which customer ID has the highest number of orders in Brazilian E-Commerce?
4. Question 5: What is the analysis of the number of purchases based on state in the Brazil region?
5. Question 6: What is the analysis of the total revenue and average revenue based on state in the Brazil region?
6. Question 7: Which payment method is most frequently used?
7. Question 8: What product is most commonly purchased in Brazilian E-Commerce?
8. Question 9: How is the trend of revenue changing each month?

# Objective
The aim of this project is to find out customer segmentation insights based on order recency, orders, frequency and transaction value as well as to get other insights such as the distribution of customers when they last placed an order, customer orders and transaction value. Therefore, I carry out data analysis using Recency, Frequency, and Monetary Analysis (RFM) so that I can conclude information to help in decision making.

# Method
The method I used in this project was Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by analyzing the data and visualizing it to gain a better understanding. The features of the dataset I use are order ID, customer ID, approved orders, and payment value.

# Conclusion
After analyzing the data, I can draw conclusions based on the results of the analysis to help answer the questions I raised.

1. Conclusion for Question 1: It can be observed that the recency, or the most recent orders from customers, is within the last 300 days.
2. Conclusion for Question 2: From the data analysis, it is evident that the purchase frequency of customers is relatively low, indicating that customers don't make frequent purchases on the Brazilian E-Commerce platform.
3. Conclusion for Question 3: The analysis reveals that the amount of money spent by customers is not exceptionally high. The majority of customers fall within the range of approximately 50 to 80 Brazilian reals.
4. Conclusion for Question 4: The top 5 customers with the highest number of purchases made a total of 29 items in the Brazilian E-Commerce dataset, while the lowest among them made 19 items.
5. Conclusion for Question 5: The region with the highest number of purchases is SP, followed by RJ.
6. Conclusion for Question 6: The highest total revenue is observed in the SP region. However, when looking at the average expenditure per purchase, the PB region has a higher average spending compared to SP.
7. Conclusion for Question 7: It is evident that the most frequently used payment method is credit card.
8. Conclusion for Question 8: The top 5 products with the highest number of purchases are bed_bath_table, health_beauty, sports_leisure, furniture_decor, and computer_accessories.
9. Conclusion for Question 9: The highest revenue is recorded in December 2017 and June 2018.
